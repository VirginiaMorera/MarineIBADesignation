# IBA Designation from at-sea data UPDATES

 </strong>IMPORTANT: This 'updates' branch is a experimental. Some of the original marine IBA code is ~ 5 years old and has relies on old R packages. I will update various scripts as I use them. Note I am running Linux, but will try update script so it functions on all platforms :)

These are a collection of codes for helping in the designation of marine IBAs using at-sea data (tracking)

If using these codes, please cite the following paper:   
<strong>Lascelles, B. G., Taylor, P. R., Miller, M. G. R., Dias, M. P., Oppel, S., Torres, L., Hedd, A., Le Corre, M., Phillips, R. A., Shaffer, S. A., Weimerskirch, H. and Small, C., </strong> 2016. <i>Applying global criteria to tracking data to define important areas for marine conservation.</i> Diversity and Distributions 22:422-431.

The codes in ths respository are brought together in the mIBA_functions_par.R file, but have been split out into individual R files for ease of use.
